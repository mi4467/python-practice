# CHAPTER 10: INTRODUCING PYTHON STATEMENTS

# INTRODUCTION
# Python is a procedural statement based language, by combining statements we specify a procedure that
## Python performs to acchive the programs goals

# WHAT PYTHON ADDS
# 1) The ':' is used to nest statements under a header statement
# EX: if x < y :
#  #     x = y

# WHAT PYTHON REMOVES
# 1) Parenthesis are optional after if/while
# 2) Semi-Colons after each statement is removed, the EOL is treated as the end of the statement
# 3) No need  for blocks (i.e brackets with code inside), can use tab or space bar

# SOME SPECIAL EXCEPTION
# 1) Squeezing multiple statements in one line via ;, ex: a =1; b=2; print(a+b)
# 2) Any code that has its block closed by )]}
# 3) When the body of a compound statement can appear next to the header, i.e if x > y : print(x)
# THINGS TO LOOK UP LATER
# 1) This chapter is kinda like a brief summary/intro, refer back as a quick lookup
